- [ ] `gapir completed` and maybe other commands could benefit from time columns that show when the reviewer was assigned and when the approval was done. I believe that data can be extracted from the threads of a PR as specific static comments. I also think that threads can be retrieved in the call that lists the PR (expand ?) which would increase the time to query only marginally.
